# 🌟 Features-First Tour Design

## ✅ What Changed

**Priority:** Features are now the STAR, tour cards are subtle guides!

---

## 🎯 Design Philosophy

**Before:**
- Tour cards were prominent (70% transparent, large)
- Features were dimmed (20% dark overlay)
- Cards competed for attention

**After:**
- **Features BRIGHT and CLEAR** (5% overlay, brightness boost!)
- **Tour cards subtle** (85% opaque, smaller, side-positioned)
- **Clear hierarchy** - features first, cards second

---

## 💡 Visibility Changes

### **1. Background Overlay - Almost Invisible!**

```css
BEFORE: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2)  /* 20% dark */
AFTER:  rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.05) /* 5% dark - barely there! */
```

**Result:** Background features stay **bright and clear!**

---

### **2. Tour Cards - Subtle Guides**

```css
BEFORE:
- 70% transparent (too see-through)
- Large and prominent
- Competed with features

AFTER:
- 85% opaque (subtle but readable)
- Smaller (400px max width)
- Side-positioned with arrows
- Less padding (20px)
```

**Result:** Cards guide without dominating!

---

### **3. Highlighted Features - BRIGHT!**

```css
NEW ENHANCEMENTS:
- Brightness filter: 115%
- Stronger purple glow (100% opacity)
- Enhanced cyan secondary glow (70%)
- Subtle purple tint (3%)
- Higher z-index (10001)
```

**Result:** Features literally **glow and stand out!**

---

## 🎨 Visual Hierarchy

```
1st Priority: FEATURES (bright, glowing, clear)
    ↓
2nd Priority: Tour cards (subtle, side-positioned)
    ↓
3rd Priority: Background (barely dimmed, 5%)
```

**The eye is drawn to the features first!**

---

## 🎯 Design Principles Applied

### **1. Visual Hierarchy:**
Most important = Most visible
- Features: Brightest (115%)

- Background: Barely affected (5% dim)

### **2. Focal Point:**
User's attention goes to:
1. Glowing feature (bright + purple glow)
2. Arrow from tour card
3. Tour card text

### **3. Non-Intrusive:**
- Cards don't block features
- Positioned to the side
- Arrows guide without blocking
- Background stays clear
