# Security Audit Report
**Date:** October 23, 2025  
**Project:** Consty - Construction Management System

## üîí Security Assessment Summary

### Status: ‚úÖ **SECURED**

---

## Issues Found & Fixed

### üö® **CRITICAL: Exposed Supabase Credentials** (FIXED)

**Issue:** Supabase URL and API keys were hardcoded in source code  
**Location:** `src/integrations/supabase/client.ts`  
**Risk Level:** CRITICAL  
**Status:** ‚úÖ RESOLVED

#### What Was Exposed:
- Supabase Project URL: `https://jkzxdvyjhljzvuydnbap.supabase.co`
- Supabase Anon Key: `eyJhbGci...` (JWT token)

#### Potential Impact:
- Unauthorized database access
- Data breach (worker info, payroll, attendance)
- API quota abuse
- Reputation damage

#### Actions Taken:
1. ‚úÖ Moved credentials to `.env` file (not tracked by git)
2. ‚úÖ Updated `.gitignore` to exclude `.env` files
3. ‚úÖ Modified `client.ts` to use environment variables
4. ‚úÖ Created `.env.example` template for developers
5. ‚úÖ Removed `.env` from git tracking
6. ‚úÖ Added validation to check for missing env variables

---

## Current Security Status

### ‚úÖ **Secured Items:**

1. **Environment Variables**
   - `.env` file created with credentials
   - `.env` added to `.gitignore`
   - `.env` removed from git tracking
   - `.env.example` created for team reference

2. **Code Security**
   - No hardcoded credentials in source code
   - Environment variable validation added
   - Proper error messages for missing credentials

3. **Git Security**
   - `.env` will not be committed to repository
   - Sensitive data protected from GitHub exposure

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Recommendations:**

1. **Rotate Supabase Keys (IMPORTANT)**
   - Go to [Supabase Dashboard](https://app.supabase.com)
   - Navigate to Project Settings > API
   - Generate new anon key (since old one was in git history)
   - Update `.env` file with new key

2. **Enable Row Level Security (RLS)**
   - Ensure all Supabase tables have RLS enabled
   - Define proper access policies for authenticated users
   - Restrict admin operations to specific roles

3. **Additional Security Measures**
   - Consider implementing rate limiting
   - Add CORS configuration in Supabase
   - Enable email verification for new signups
   - Implement password strength requirements
   - Add audit logging for sensitive operations

4. **Git History Cleanup (Optional but Recommended)**
   - Since the old credentials were in git history, consider using `git filter-branch` or `BFG Repo-Cleaner` to remove them from history
   - Or simply rotate the keys (easier option)

5. **Production Deployment**
   - Never commit production credentials
   - Use deployment platform's environment variable system (Vercel, Netlify, etc.)
   - Set up separate Supabase projects for dev/staging/production

---

## Files Modified

1. `src/integrations/supabase/client.ts` - Uses environment variables
2. `.gitignore` - Excludes .env files
3. `.env` - Contains actual credentials (NOT tracked by git)
4. `.env.example` - Template for developers (tracked by git)

---

## How Other Developers Should Set Up

When cloning this project, developers should:

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env`
2. Get Supabase credentials from team lead
3. Update `.env` with actual values
4. Run `npm install` and `npm run dev`

---

## Next Steps

### Immediate:
- ‚úÖ All critical issues fixed
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Consider rotating Supabase keys

### Before Production:
- [ ] Set up environment variables in hosting platform
- [ ] Review and enable all Supabase RLS policies
- [ ] Set up monitoring and alerts
- [ ] Implement rate limiting
- [ ] Add security headers

## Notes

The Supabase **Anon Key** is safe to use in client-side code as long as:
1. Row Level Security (RLS) is properly configured
2. It's not committed to public repositories
3. You have proper database policies in place

The **Service Role Key** should NEVER be used in client-side code or committed anywhere.
