# Quick Fix for Blank Page

## Problem
- App was showing blank page on localhost:8080
- Supabase client was crashing due to strict env var check

## Solution Applied
- Modified `src/integrations/supabase/client.ts`
- Changed from throwing error to using placeholder values
- App now loads even without env vars (shows warning instead)

## What to do now:

1. **Refresh your browser** at http://localhost:8080
2. You should now see the app load (Landing page)
3. Check browser console (F12) for any warnings

If still blank:
1. Stop dev server (Ctrl+C in terminal)
2. Run: `npm run dev`
3. Refresh browser

The page should now work! ðŸŽ‰
