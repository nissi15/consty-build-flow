# ðŸ“‹ Safe Migration Plan to constry.vercel.app

## Step 1: Create New Project (Keeps Old One Running)
We'll create a **NEW** Vercel project called "constry" that:
- âœ… Gets the URL: `constry.vercel.app`
- âœ… Keeps `consty-build-flow.vercel.app` running
- âœ… Uses the same GitHub repo
- âœ… Uses the same Supabase database (your data is safe!)

## Step 2: Add Environment Variables to New Project
Add these to the new "constry" project:
- VITE_SUPABASE_URL
- VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY

## Step 3: Test New Project
- Open `constry.vercel.app`
- Test all features
- Verify your data is there

## Step 4: Choose Which to Keep
### Option A: Keep Both
- Use `constry.vercel.app` for production
- Keep old one as backup

### Option B: Delete Old One
- After confirming new one works
- Delete `consty-build-flow` project
- Only use `constry.vercel.app`

## Safe Benefits
âœ… Both projects share the SAME database (Supabase)  
âœ… Your data is in ONE place (protected)  
âœ… Old project stays as backup  
âœ… Can test new one safely  
âœ… Can delete old one anytime

I'll create the new "constry" project without touching the old one.
